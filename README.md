Hello, I'm Betül 👋

🎓 I graduated from Yıldız Technical University with a degree in Electrical Engineering in 2023. During my university education, I built a solid technical foundation, but my true passion lies in data science and machine learning, which was ignited through various bootcamps and events I attended.
